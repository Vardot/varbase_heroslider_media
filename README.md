# Varbase Hero Slider Media

 used on the homepage in most cases.

Now you can install Varbase Media Hero Slider with any Drupal 8 site. Even
 if installed with the Minimal or Standard profile.

However, using it with Varbase distro and Vartheme or Bootstrap theme gives
 you way much more cool stuff!
